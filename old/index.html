        <h1>Cozis's blog!</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Francesco Cozzuto and I'm a computer programmer based in Naples (Italy). I really like building stuff, especially the kind that runs on computers! The social I'm most active on is <a href="https://github.com/cozis">GitHub</a>. I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cozis947">YouTube</a> channel, but don't post much on it. Recently I started using <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cozis/">LinkedIn</a>. People can reach me at francesco.cozzuto [at] gmail.com
        </p>

        <h2>Things I think about</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming is art and getting better at it means getting to know yourself better</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel">Reinventing the wheel</a> is not only cool but essential for an aspiring programmer</li>
            <li>An online version of Pokemon Emerald would be soo sick</li>
            <li>Sofware with many dependencies sucks. You probably need far less than you think, and if you reinvented the wheel enough in the past you know that some of your use-cases might be basic enough you can get away with writing the code yourself</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cool things about me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimal web pages make me happy</li>
            <li>I like to <a href="draw.html">draw</a> and studied art before enrolling at uni for Computer Engineering</li>
            <li>I drink about 6 cups of coffee a day (I guess it being cool is up for debate)</li>
            <li>You may not believe this, but I have the best <a href="leo.html">cat</a> in the world</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Software I made that I'm proud about</h2>
        <table border=1>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <td>Name</td>
                    <td>Description</td>

            <tr>
                <td><a href="https://github.com/cozis/microtcp">MicroTCP</a></td>
                <td>Very minimal implementation of a TCP/IP network stack. You can run it on Windows and Linux alongside the kernel's network stack using a TAP device (which you need to install on Windows). It should be possible to run it on bare metal but havent tried yet.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="https://github.com/cozis/xHTTP">xHTTP</a></td>
                <td>Tiny HTTP/1.1 server library for Linux. I'm not convinced about the API though and started focusing my effort on another HTTP implementation called <a href="https://github.com/cozis/chttp">chttp</a>)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="https://github.com/cozis/Noja">Noja</a></td>
                <td>This project has a special place in my heart. It's the interpreter for a language called Noja I came up with. Being able to code in my own language was a dream come true!</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="https://github.com/cozis/tinytemplate">TinyTemplate</a></td>
                <td>Lightweight Templating engine. The intended use-case is to generate dynamic web pages.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="https://github.com/cozis/c2html">c2html</a></td>
                <td>Tool to add HTML syntax highlighting tags to snippets of C code. In case you looove long variable names, it can elaborate text at more than 1GB/s!</td>
            </tr>
